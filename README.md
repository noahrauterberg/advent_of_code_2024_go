Go solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Please note that I am new to the go language and use the advent of code to learn go.
I am also not familiar with language specifics and the solutions provided here are not optimized in any way.

Each day has its own directory with the source code of the solution.
This solution assumes a file called `input.txt` to be present in the same directory that contains the input to the puzzle.
However, these files are excluded from the git repository.
In order to run the solution, you can either use the `gorun <day>.go` command directly or first build an executable and then execute it using:

```shell
go build <day>.go
./<day>
```
